    <p>Here is a quote from Melanie about her perfect potato</p>
    <blockquote>She loves him more than <b>life</b> itself. However he is sometimes a pain in the ass and makes me sad inside because I swear to god he has a death wish. Like the time he ate 18 chocolate balls. Or tinfoil. Or plastic. Or I shit you not, a fucking blu ray player. </blockquote>
    <p>Mel's goal is: <q>Stop him from dying</q></p>

    <h2>Trigger</h2>
      <p>Trigger is now over 8 years old. He was originally adopted from a person listing him on Craigslist. He had been adopted 3 times before me, even though he was only 10 weeks old.</p>
      <p>Once I picked him up, it was clear that he had spent his first few weeks with humans neglected. In addition he was covered in ticks, had a severe case of worms, and had small burn marks on his legs. He smelled terrible but it was love at first sight. I promised him that no matter how difficult he got, I would love him more than anything in this world.</p>
